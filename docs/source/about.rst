About SonPy
===========

Credits
-------
SonPy was developed in the `Engineering Quantum Systems Group <http://equs.mit.edu/>`_ at Massachusetts Insitute of Technology in the spring/summer of 2018. Its first version was written by Niels Jakob Søe Loft (nsl@phys.au.dk) with great help from Bharath Kannan. The project was inspired by `work <https://www.sonnetsoftware.com/support/downloads/Aces2011/13_11_20111096.pdf>`_ by Daniel Becerra-Pérez and José E. Rayas-Sánchez, who were very kind to share their code with us. Further development was done by Megan Yamoah.

This documentation was generated by `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_. Remember to document your contributions to the code, and compile a new documentation (like this one) using Sphinx and the command ``make latexpdf`` from the ``docs`` directory. The new pdf documentation is found in the ``_build`` directory.

**Version 1.0:** Niels Jakob Søe Loft

**Version 1.1:** Megan Yamoah

Purpose
--------
SonPy was developed in an effort to automate some of the tedious and time consuming work that is circuit design by creating a Python interface for the commercial simulation software Sonnet. It is designed to fit the specific needs of the EQuS Group. Therefore it covers only a subset of the functionality in Sonnet, but it is straightforward to include more of Sonnet's many possibilities. SonPy is written for Python 3.

Sonnet comes for both Linux and Windows, but SonPy is developed and tested only for the Windows version. However, it should be relatively straightforward to change the file paths and subprocess handling in SonPy to fit Linux standards.
